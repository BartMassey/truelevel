# truelevel -- audio file compresor / limiter
Copyright &copy; 2006-2014 Bart Massey

This program is a simple command-line compressor / limiter
for WAVE format audio files.  There is precious little
documentation at this point; that needs to be fixed soon.

I'm not really working on this Haskell code any longer; I
rewrote it in Java for a project I'm working on.  However, I
think it's a nice demo app for my
[WAVE library](http://github.com/BartMassey/WAVE).
